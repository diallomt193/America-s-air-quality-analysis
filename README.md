# Project-1
BCS Bootcamp first project analyzing Air Quality in America

# Background

Air quality plays a very important role in our daily lives, it affects everybody. We need clean and safe air to live well, and air pollution can trigger many health issues. 
This issue is important today because of the great impact on our future and thus need to increase our awareness.

# Overview 

Emissions of air pollutants continue to play an important role in a number of air quality issues.

The team analyzed the changes of 3 major air pollutants across various cities in the United States from 2011-2020:

* O3 (Ozone)
* NO2 (Nitrogen Dioxide)
* SO2 (Sulfur Dioxide)

In the link provided below, our team created a presentation that analyzes the 3 pollutants over the years with data and graphs depicting the overall trends.

# Data  

The Team used data from EPA (United States Environmental Protection Agency) to analyze the trend of each pollutant from 2011-2020:

# Tools Used 

* Excel (Filter Data)
* Python (Write Code for Jupyter Notebook)
* Jupyter Notebook (Filter Data and Create Graphs)

# The Team 

* Mariama Diallo
* Herman Tucker
* Blanca Carretero

# Challenges 

The biggest challenge was writing the code for the data set. We wanted to write a code where the graphs can change based on the city chosen from the data set. We finally figured it out, but in the future, we would go back and change the code to choose a city from a specific year instead of the city. It would make the code more user friendly for those who have no experience with coding. 

# Successes 

We had fun working together as a team and actually applying what we learned over the weeks. 

# Overall 

The team enjoyed analyzing the trends of air pollutants over the years. We hope that more countries around the world implement their own regulations against
